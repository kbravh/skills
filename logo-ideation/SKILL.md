# Logo Ideation

Develop logo concepts through brand discovery, competitive analysis, and visual exploration. Output is a concept brief ready for svg-logo-creator.

## Workflow

### 1. Brand Discovery

Gather essential context. Ask about:

- **Name & tagline**: What text must appear?
- **Industry & offering**: What does the company do?
- **Target audience**: Who are the customers?
- **Brand personality**: 3-5 adjectives (e.g., "modern, trustworthy, innovative")
- **Existing brand elements**: Colors, fonts, or visual assets already in use?
- **Constraints**: Must avoid certain imagery? Required formats?

### 2. Competitive Analysis

Use WebSearch to find 5-10 competitor logos. Analyze:

- **Common patterns**: What visual themes dominate the industry?
- **Color trends**: What palette is overused?
- **Typography**: Serif vs sans-serif prevalence?
- **Differentiation opportunities**: What's missing? What would stand out?

Document findings as a brief competitive landscape summary.

### 3. Visual Direction Exploration

Generate 3-5 distinct concept directions. For each:

**Concept name**: Short memorable title
**Logo type**: See reference below
**Visual metaphor**: Core imagery/symbolism
**Color direction**: Primary palette reasoning
**Typography style**: Font characteristics
**Personality fit**: How it reflects brand adjectives
**Differentiation**: How it stands apart from competitors

### 4. Concept Brief Output

Deliver a structured brief for each viable direction:

```

**Metaphor**: [Core visual idea]
**Colors**: [Primary, secondary, rationale]
